## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Images not showing** | Images need to be hosted online with HTTPS URLs. Check with IT. |
| **Links not clickable** | Try copying again from browser, not from Word or text editor. |
| **Formatting looks wrong** | Use Chrome or Edge to open the HTML file, not Internet Explorer. |
| **Signature too wide** | This is normal for mobile; it will scale down automatically. |
| **Changes not showing** | Close and reopen Outlook, or restart your computer. |
